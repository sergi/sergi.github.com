Hi, I'm Sergi.

I am a software developer currently working on [Firefox
OS](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/), which I also spend some time
evengelizing to developers around the world. We are trying to bring it to the
developing world by making it run in affordable devices.

In the past I helped building [an IDE that runs entirely on JavaScript and
Node.JS](http://c9.io) and I lead the team that implemented the framework that
powers the visual interface in [TomTom](http://tomtom.com) devices.

I like to tinker with different programming languages and software paradigms.
I am currently interested in Reactive programming and in fact, I am writing a
book about using reactive programming in JavaScript that will be out at the
beginning of 2015.

Originally from Barcelona, I live in the lovely city of Amsterdam, where I
organize the popular monthly [AmsterdamJS
meetup](http://www.meetup.com/AmsterdamJS/).
