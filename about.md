# Sergi Mansilla


I am a software developer currently working on the core of [Firefox
OS](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/) and designing Node.js systems
for [Telenor
Digital](http://www.telenor.com/about-us/our-business/telenor-digital/). I
also do lots of public speaking about software development around the world.

In the past, among other things, I helped build Cloud9, [an IDE that runs entirely
on JavaScript and Node.JS](http://c9.io), and I led the team that implemented
the framework powering the visual interface in [TomTom](http://tomtom.com) GPS
devices.

I love to tinker with software and programming languages in [my free
time](https://github.com/sergi).
My most recent interest is with Reactive programming and in fact, [I wrote a
book about it for Pragmatic
Programmers](https://pragprog.com/book/smreactjs/reactive-programming-with-rxjs).

Originally from Barcelona, I live in the lovely city of Amsterdam, where I
organize the popular [AmsterdamJS
meetup](http://www.meetup.com/AmsterdamJS/).
