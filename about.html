    <h1>Hi. I'm Sergi.</h1>

    <p>I work at [Telenor Digital](https://twitter.com/TelenorDigital) contributing to Firefox OS core, and I also evangelize and organize events around it. Before that I worked at [Cloud9 IDE](http://c9.io/) making an online IDE entirely in Node.js and JavaScript, and before that I lead the team that implemented the webkit framework that run the UIs in modern TomTom devices.</p>

    <p>I like to mess with programming languages. I prefer functional languages, but I try to treat languages as tools, some are better at the task at hand that others. My usual tools of trade are vim, JavaScript and OCaml, and lately some Clojure and Go ahve been thrown into the mix. I live in Amsterdam, and I am originally from Barcelona. In Amsterdam I organize the popular monthly <a href="http://www.meetup.com/AmsterdamJS/">AmsterdamJS meetup</a>.</p>

    <p>You can find me on any of these:</p>
